   <p>
    The Salmon River originates in the Sawtooth and Lemhi Valleys of central and eastern Idaho. Springs and snowmelt feed this wild river as it makes its way through the second-deepest gorge on the continent; only Hells Canyon on the Snake River is deeper. The Salmon's granite-walled canyon is over 1,000 feet deeper than the Grand Canyon. For approximately 180 miles, the Salmon River canyon is more than a mile deep.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wild section of the Salmon consists of 79-miles of free-flowing river in the heart of the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, between Corn Creek and Long Tom Bar.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Main Salmon River is a renowned whitewater/wilderness float trip, known for its history, scenic beauty, big water, and sandy beaches. The Salmon provides an amazing mix of adventure and tranquility that makes it an excellent family trip. Each year, approximately 10,000 people float this beautiful river.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Salmon River is historically known as The River of No Return. For more than 105 years after the first European Americans came to the area, only one-way trips down the river were possible. The most commonly used boats were wooden scows, designed to carry heavy loads and withstand whitewater. They were then dismantled and used for lumber at the trips' conclusion. It was from these trips that the Salmon's nickname, "River of No Return," originated.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Salmon is administered under a permit system to protect it from excessive human impacts. Part of that protection asks you, the user, to learn and practice Leave No Trace ethics. Because of its remote location, man's presence in the area was somewhat limited, leaving it in the condition we see today.

   <p>
    <strong>
     The Reservation/Application Fee ($6.00) is non-refundable.
