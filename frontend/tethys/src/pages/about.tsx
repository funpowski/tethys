                        Tethys is a permit scraper for rec.gov. Lots of people are applying for river permits every year and it is getting harder and harder to get them.

                    TBD on if this will be publicly available. Alerting for permit cancellations are kind of a zero sum game.
                    If a bunch of people want primo cancellation dates and they're all subscribed to alerts then it becomes a function of who has the quickest trigger finger.

                    This project scrapes rec.gov on a regular cadence - every hour an AWS lambda function takes a "snapshot" of the availability calendar and identifies changes in availability state.

                    When an availability transition is detected it is logged to a database and a slack message is sent to users who set up an alert for the given river.
